# SNGAT-LDA
SNGAT-LDA** is a novel graph neural network-based model designed for link prediction tasks in both dense and sparse networks. It combines **Structural Neighborhood Graph Attention Network (SNGAT)** with **Local Degree Awareness (LDA)** to effectively capture both local and global structural information in various types of real-world networks.
Key Features

- Combines the expressiveness of GAT with local degree-based attention weighting.
- Designed to perform well on both dense and sparse graphs.
- Evaluated on multiple datasets: Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, Facebook, Wiki, PolBlogs, Email, Twitter, etc.
- Includes comparative baselines and ablation studies.
- Easily extendable and reproducible.
